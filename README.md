Mama was queen of the mambo, Papa was king of the Congo
Deep down in the jungle I started bangin' my first bongo
Every monkey'd like to be in my place instead of me
'Cause I'm the king of bongo, baby I'm the king of bongo bong

I went to the big town where there is a lot of sound
From the jungle to the city looking for a bigger crown
So I play my boogie for the people of big city
But they don't go crazy when I'm bangin' on my boogie

### I'm the "king of the bongo, king of the bongo bong"
### Hear me when I come, baby
### "King of the bongo, king of the bongo bong"
